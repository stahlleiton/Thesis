\chapter{Experimental setup} \label{sec:Experiment}

% INTRODUCTION OF CHAPTER
\initial{T}his chapter provides a brief overview of the experimental setup employed to acquire the data used in this thesis. The data is derived from high energy collisions of protons and lead ions  recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the settings of the particle collisions are described in \sect{sec:Experiment_LHC}. The main features of the CMS detector and its components are detailed in \sect{sec:Experiment_CMS}.
