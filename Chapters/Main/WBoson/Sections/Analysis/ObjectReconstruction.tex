\subsubsection{Online Muon Selection} \label{sec:WBoson_Analysis_MuonTrigger}

As mentioned in \sect{sec:Introduction_Detector}, the muon triggers are divided in two systems: the Level-1 (L1) trigger and the High Level Trigger (HLT). Event are selected in two steps, first the L1 muon trigger checks for the presence of tracks with $\pt > 7$~\GeVc measured in the muon detectors, and then the HLT accept events with at least one reconstructed muon with $\pt > 12$~\GeVc.
