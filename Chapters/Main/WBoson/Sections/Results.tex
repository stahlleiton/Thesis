\section{W boson production in \pPb collisions at $\sqrtsnn = \SI{8.16}{\TeV}$}\label{sec:WBoson_Results}

This section presents the results of the analysis of the production of {\PW} bosons in \pPb collisions at $\sqrtsnn = \SI{8.16}{\TeV}$ performed in the semi-muonic decay channel, using a data sample with integrated luminosity of $173.4 \pm 5.9$~\nbinv~\cite{LUMI}. The {\PW} boson yields are extracted in the muon kinematic region defined by $\pt^{\mu} > 25$~\GeVc and $\abs{\etaLAB^{\mu}} < 2.4$. The {\PW}  boson differential cross sections, the muon charge asymmetry, and the muon forward-backward ratios are measured as a function of muon \etaCM. The measurements are compared to PDF calculations both without and with including nuclear modifications, and also to results from other LHC experiments.
