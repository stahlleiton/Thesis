\section{Results}\label{sec:WBoson_Results}

This section presents the analysis results of the \Wb-boson production in \pPb collisions at $\sqrtsnn = \SI{8.16}{\TeV}$. The \Wb-boson yields are extracted in the muon kinematic region defined by $\pt^{\mu} > 25$~\GeVc and $\abs{\etaLAB^{\mu}} < 2.4$. The \WToMuNu differential cross sections, the muon charge asymmetry, and the forward-backward ratios are measured as a function of muon \etaMuCM. The measurements are compared to PDF calculations with and without including nuclear modifications.
