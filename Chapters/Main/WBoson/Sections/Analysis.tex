\section{Analysis} \label{sec:WBoson_Analysis}

In this section, the analysis of the \Wb-boson production in \RunpPb collisions at $\sqrtsnn = \SI{8.16}{\TeV}$,  is described. The measurement is performed in the \WToMuNupm decay channel using data recorded with the CMS detector and the signal event yields are extracted from the missing transverse momentum \ptmiss distributions. The analysis is currently in the final stage of the internal collaboration review and will be submitted to a peer-review journal in the near future.

The dataset used is introduced in \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Samples_Data}, the NLO simulations for the signal and background processes are listed in \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Sample_MC}, and the event selection is described in  \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Selection}. The corrections for the simulated weak boson \pt and the \ptmiss are explained in \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Corrections_WeakBosonPTReweighing} and \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Corrections_MET}, respectively. The measurement of the signal efficiency is presented in \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Efficiency} and the extraction of the signal event yields is detailed in \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_SignalExtraction}. The observables of the analysis are introduced in \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Observables}. In \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis_Systematics}, the different sources of systematic uncertainties and the methods employed to estimate them are presented.
