\chapter{\Wb-boson production in proton-lead collisions} \label{sec:WBoson}

% INTRODUCTION OF CHAPTER

\initial{T}his chapter reports the measurement of the production of \Wb bosons in proton-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\sqrtsnn = \SI{8.16}{\TeV}$ with the CMS detector. A brief introduction to the theory of electroweak interactions and the \Wb-boson production in \RunpPb collisions is presented in \sect{sec:WBoson_Introduction}. This section concludes with a overview of the latest measurements of weak-boson production in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The \Wb-boson analysis is then described in detailed in \sect{sec:WBoson_Analysis}. In \sect{sec:WBoson_Results}, the results of the \Wb-boson analysis are presented and compared to theoretical calculations based on PDFs.
