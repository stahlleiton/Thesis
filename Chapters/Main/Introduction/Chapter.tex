\chapter{High energy nuclear physics} \label{sec:Introduction}

% INTRODUCTION OF CHAPTER

\initial{T}his chapter introduces the concepts of high energy nuclear physics relevant for the analysis of the production of {\PW} bosons and J/$\psi$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions. The elementary particles and fundamental interactions of the standard model are described in \sect{sec:Introduction_SM}. In addition, the extreme state of hot dense hadronic matter known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the study of the its properties in heavy-ion collisions is reviewed in \sect{sec:Introduction_HI}.
