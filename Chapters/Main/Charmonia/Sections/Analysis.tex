\section{Analysis} \label{sec:Charmonia_Analysis}

In this section, two related analyses of the charmonium production in \Runpp and \RunPbPb collisions at $\sqrtsnn = \SI{5.02}{\TeV}$, are described. The measurements are performed in the \mumu decay channel using data recorded with the CMS detector. In both of the analyses, I made significant contributions in the signal extraction, acceptance studies and determination of the systematic uncertainties related to the fitting procedure.

The first analysis~\cite{CMS_JPsi_PbPb_5p02TeV} studies the modification of the prompt and nonprompt \JPsi meson production in \RunPbPb compared to \Runpp collisions at the same energy. To accomplish this, the nuclear modification factor of \JPsi mesons is measured in different collision centrality bins, and \JPsi-meson \pt and rapidity (\rap) ranges. The second analysis~\cite{CMS_Psi2S_PbPb_5p02TeV} probes the nuclear modification of \PsiP mesons relative to \JPsi mesons, by measuring the double ratio of \PsiP over \JPsi yields in \RunPbPb relative to \Runpp collisions, defined as:

\begin{equation}
 \rho^{\PsiP/\JPsi} = \frac{\left(N_{\PsiP}/N_{\JPsi}\right)_{\PbPb}}{\left(N_{\PsiP}/N_{\JPsi}\right)_{\pp}}
\end{equation}

One advantage of measuring the double ratio of charmonium yields is that the acceptance and efficiency of the two charmonium states cancel in the ratio due their similar masses and production mechanisms. For this reason, as well as the limited statistics of the \PsiP mesons compared to \JPsi mesons, the second analysis was published first and relatively fast after the data was taken, while the first analysis was more elaborate and required more time to complete.


The \Runpp and \RunPbPb datasets employed are introduced in \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_Data}, while the charmonium simulations are listed in \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_MC} and the event selection is presented in \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_Selection}. The procedure used to extract the prompt and nonprompt \JPsi-meson yields is explained in \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_JPsiYieldExtraction} and the extraction of the single ratios of \PsiP over \JPsi meson yields is detailed in \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_PsiPoverJPsiRatioExtraction}. The charmonium efficiency and acceptance are derived in \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_Efficiency}. \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_JPsiYieldSystematics} and \sect{sec:Charmonia_Analysis_PsiPoverJPsiRatioSystematics} report the systematic uncertainties associated to the measurement of the \JPsi-meson yields and the double ratio of charmonium yields, respectively.
